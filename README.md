# X-Ray-Diagnostics-Using-machine-learning

1.Introduction

X-ray diagnostics is an important part of medical imaging that uses electromagnetic radiation to create images of the human body. These images are used to diagnose and treat various medical conditions. In recent years, machine learning has emerged as a powerful tool in medical imaging, allowing for more accurate and efficient diagnosis of diseases.

This project aims to explore the use of machine learning algorithms in X-ray diagnostics. Specifically, we will use deep learning techniques to develop a model that can accurately classify X-ray images based on the presence or absence of certain medical conditions.

We will be using a dataset of X-ray images that has been annotated by medical professionals. This dataset will be used to train our model and evaluate its performance.

The project will involve several steps, including data preprocessing, model development, and evaluation. We will also explore techniques for visualizing and interpreting the results of our model.

This project has the potential to significantly improve the accuracy and efficiency of X-ray diagnostics. By automating the process of image classification, we can help medical professionals make more informed diagnoses and improve patient outcomes.

2.Requirements:

To run this project, you'll need:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Numpy
- Pandas
- Scikit-Learn
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- Matplotlib


3.Dataset


We used the Chest X-Ray Images (Pneumonia) dataset from Kaggle, which contains 5,863 X-ray images of healthy and pneumonia-infected lungs.
You can download the dataset from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia

For execution you can run the python file and do the implementation and by opening the application file you can find the frontend related implementation.

5.Results

We achieved an accuracy of 99% on the test set using a convolutional neural network (CNN) model. The model can classify X-ray images as either healthy or infected with pneumonia.

We have also achived test accuracy of 71%

6.Conclusion

Machine learning can be a valuable tool for diagnosing medical conditions from X-ray images. Our model achieved high accuracy and can be used to assist doctors and radiologists in making diagnoses. However, further research and validation are needed before deploying the model in clinical settings.
